# T

CDS components replicate the rough, noisy outer surface of real-world objects through its texture ‘T’. The texture is composed of three major parts: blur, grain, and gradient.
Together they form an elegant-looking texture that stands as a backbone for the uniqueness and user interface of CDS.

The overall theme of CDS is wholly incorporated in our texture ‘T’.
It has a transparent fading effect that symbolizes the ever-growing, slow development to something great as the word ‘continuum’ explains.
The noise adds a real-world beauty of imperfection. CDS backgrounds are preferred to be dynamic. Hence we provide a translucent surface for aesthetic purposes.

## Components of T

### Gradient

The gradient of T is made from accent color as base. The gradient extends from the accent color and fades with transparency. Diagonally positioned radial gradient is used to get
a smooth and natural transition. This diagonalized gradient and opaque accent color ensures that the text part ohe component is visible and readable.

### Grain Noise

The grain part adds a roughness to the texture, making it look more realistic. There are many kinds of noises such as white noise, dark noise, static noise, gaussian noise, etc.
We have used a white noise for 'R'. The size of the grain is chosen in a way that it is not too big for blending in with the gradient and not too small for being visible.
The grain also has a fading effect same as the gradient for forming the common area of translucency.

### Blur

The translucent/blur part provides a soft and smooth look to the texture.
