# Introduction

The word **_continuum_** stands for something that persists in existing for a long period of time
and evolves gradually throughout this phase of development.
The end point of the so far advanced product would be so much different from the point of emergence.
The outlook from which the design system relates to this idea is as follows.

## Continuum in Emergence

The universe began from a point of infinite density and gravity called the singularity and expands every day.
Similarly, CDS started from a spark of infinite curiosity and evolves exponentially.

## Continuum in Design

> The universe is a symphony of chaos, where beauty plays in every note.

Our components replicates the similar beauty that flows from a not so perfect tangible reality.

{/_ The vast universe is composed of tiny atoms and every physical object is not perfect.
Likewise, the design of our components mimics the texture of a tangible reality. _/}

## Continuum in Development

We as developers know what are the hardships of developing a software.So, CDS focusses not only
on the user experience but also on the developer experience.
